# Credit Risk Analysis


## <b>Overview of the analysis:</b>

The purpose of the analysis was to predict credit card risk using data from Lending Club by running the data through different machine learning models.  To be able to make a good recommendation, I used many different machine learning models by oversampling, undersampling and combining the two approaches.  In addition, I used two additional models to reduce bias to predict credit risk.  After reviewing all the models and looking at the accuracy, precision, reclass and the F1 score I was able to make a recommendation on the best model.

## <b>Results</b>

Outcome of each model:
 - Random Oversampling
   - The accuracy score was 63.67%, precision score was very low at only 1% and the recall was 62%.
